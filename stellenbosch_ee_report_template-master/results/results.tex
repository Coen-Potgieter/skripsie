\section{Qualatative Results}
Going to see if model output can identify these well known droughts happened in the years: 1983-84, 1991-92, 1994-95, 2014-16, and 2017-18,
Lets just begin plotting things...

Here we can do the Accuracy Analysis where we use a metric called Production Correct (PC), which directly compares to SPI, SDI, and NDVI....

All of the above requires viterbi output. What should I use MPM output for? Should I use it?


\section{Gauge Uncertain periods}

here we can use MPM output as a “confidence lens” \\
MPM gives per-timestep marginal posterior probabilities. \\
You can exploit that to show model uncertainty — how confident the DNBC was in each classification.
For example:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Plot both MPM and Viterbi on the same time series → when they disagree, that’s an uncertain period.
    \item Show a heatmap or shaded region over time representing the MPM confidence for the chosen (Viterbi) class.
    \item Mention that Viterbi is used for evaluation, but MPM helps interpret reliability.
\end{enumerate}
