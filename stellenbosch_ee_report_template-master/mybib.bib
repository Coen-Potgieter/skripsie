    abstract = {Abstract The multi-year (2015–2017) drought in the South West of
                the Western Cape (SWC) caused a severe water shortage in the
                summer of 2017–2018, with damaging impacts on the local and
                regional economy, and Cape Town being in the news one of the
                first major cities to potentially run out of water. Here, we
                assess the links between the rainfall deficits during the drought
                and (a) large scale circulation patterns, (b) moisture transport,
                and (c) convective available potential energy (CAPE). We used
                self-organising maps (SOM) analysis to classify daily ERA-interim
                850 hPa geopotential height for the period 1979–2017
                (March–October) into synoptic types. This allowed us to identify
                the dominant synoptic states over Southern Africa that influence
                the local climate in the area affected by the drought. The
                results show that (a) the frequency of nodes with rain-bearing
                circulation types decreased during the drought; (b) the amount of
                rain falling on days that did have rain-bearing circulation types
                was reduced, especially in the shoulder seasons (March–May and
                August–October); (c) the rainfall reduction was also associated
                with anomalously low moisture transport, and convective energy
                (CAPE), over SWC. These results add to the existing knowledge of
                drivers of the Cape Town drought, providing an understanding of
                underlying synoptic processes.},

    ABSTRACT = {This paper examines the determinants of household vulnerability
                to drought in the Western Cape province, South Africa. The study
                used secondary data collected by the Human Sciences Research
                Council (HSRC). The dataset is made up of 240 households located
                in the City of Cape Town along with two small towns in the West
                Coast District Municipality (Piketberg and Clanwilliam). While
                descriptive statistics were used to analyse households’
                socioeconomic variables, an ordered logit model was employed to
                analyse the factors contributing to households’ vulnerability to
                drought in the study area. The paper revealed that 28% of the
                households were extremely vulnerable to drought. The result of
                the ordered logit regression model showed that factors such as
                the age of the household head, communication of water
                restrictions by the authorities, household water consumption in
                the last two years, and public cooperation with water
                restrictions were significant factors influencing households’
                vulnerability to drought. It was also discovered that
                female-headed and older household members were more vulnerable to
                drought than their male-headed and younger members respectively.
                The paper concluded that to minimise vulnerability to drought
                among the households, stakeholders in the province should be
                better prepared to implement proactive policies with regard to
                climate disasters.},

    abstract = {Agriculture and the economies of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are
                highly sensitive to climatic variability. Drought, in particular,
                represents one of the most important natural factors contributing
                to malnutrition and famine in many parts of the region. The
                overall impact of drought on a given country/region and its
                ability to recover from the resulting social, economic and
                environmental impacts depends on several factors. The economic,
                social and environmental impacts of drought are huge in SSA and
                the national costs and losses incurred threaten to undermine the
                wider economic and development gains made in the last few decades
                in the region. There is an urgent need to reduce the
                vulnerability of countries to climate variability and to the
                threats posed by climate change. This paper attempts to highlight
                the challenges of drought in SSA and reviews the current drought
                risk management strategies, especially the promising
                technological and policy options for managing drought risks to
                protect livelihoods and reduce vulnerability. The review suggests
                the possibilities of several ex ante and ex post drought
                management strategies in SSA although their effectiveness depends
                on agro-climatic and socio-economic conditions. Existing
                technological, policy and institutional risk management measures
                need to be strengthened and integrated to manage drought ex ante
                and to minimize the ex post negative effects for vulnerable
                households and regions. A proactive approach that combines
                promising technological, institutional and policy solutions to
                manage the risks within vulnerable communities implemented by
                institutions operating at different levels (community,
                sub-national, and national) is considered to be the way forward
                for managing drought and climate variability.},

                experienced the combined effects of a severe drought and a strong
                El Niño event, which led to serious impacts on livelihood
                conditions and economic growth. By examining the State's response
                to drought over time, with a specific focus on responses to the
                current 2016 El Niño -related drought, we expose a number of
                ‘sticking points’ in the response to drought and the delayed
                action to reduce the risks to drought impacts. Complex and
                seemingly bureaucratic hurdles limiting action are shown to be
                cumbersome factors that impede and continue to frustrate
                effective drought response in the country. Such bureaucratic
                inability to enable swift and flexible responses resulted in many
                NGOs and civic actors stepping up to provide assistance. As
                demonstrated in this research, while there are response plans and
                key contact departments and strategies in South Africa, these
                have become mired down in officialdom. Some suggest the blame
                lies with the State itself, and its alleged poor drought risk
                governance that affect recovery after drought, especially in the
                agricultural sector. Ineffective responses are surprising given
                that drought is a familiar feature and given there have been
                several previous cases of successes in institutional response in
                the past.},

    abstract = {Since 2015 the greater Cape Town area (∼3.7 million people) has
                been experiencing the worst drought of the last century. The
                combined effect of this prolonged dry period with an ever-growing
                demand for water culminated in the widely publicized ‘Day Zero’
                water crisis. Here we show how: (i) consecutive significant
                decreases in rainfall during the last three winters led to the
                current water crisis; (ii) the 2015–2017 record breaking drought
                was driven by a poleward shift of the Southern Hemisphere
                moisture corridor; (iii) a displacement of the jet-stream and
                South Atlantic storm-track has imposed significantly drier
                conditions to this region. Decreasing local rainfall trends are
                consistent with an expansion of the semi-permanent South Atlantic
                high pressure, and reflected in the prevalence of the positive
                phase of the Southern Annular Mode. Large-scale forcing
                mechanisms reveal the intensification and migration of
                subtropical anticyclones towards the mid-latitudes, highlighting
                the link between these circulation responses and the record warm
                years during 2015–2017 at the global scale.},

    ABSTRACT = {Climate change impacts on hydrologic systems, coupled with
                increasing water demand and a growing global population, has led
                to depleted water resources in semi-arid regions around the
                world. This increase in water shortages has significant
                implications for environmental justice and equity concerns. One
                such region impacted by both water scarcity and deep-seated
                inequality is the Western Cape of South Africa, whose drought
                crisis reached peak recognition when the City of Cape Town
                released its notice of ‘Day Zero’ in 2018. This study examines
                the changes in physical factors prior to and during the 2015-2018
                drought in Cape Town and evaluates how policy decisions made in
                response to this event interacted with existing social
                injustices. Analysis of the physical data finds only a slight
                direct relationship between rainfall and dam levels (r2 = 0.3),
                suggesting a more complex narrative for the decrease in water
                supply, including increased water use and management decisions.
                Of the many policies implemented to avoid Day Zero, some were
                found to be more effective and can be utilized long term. The
                study also finds that the Cape Town water crisis has unveiled and
                heightened existing inequalities through placing a
                disproportionate financial burden on low-income communities. As
                droughts become more common, Cape Town provides a crucial case
                study for understanding the social, political, and environmental
                implications of drought management in the future.},

    abstract = {The objective of this study was to characterise meteorological
                droughts in the Central Region of South Africa using Standardised
                Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and to examine if
                there is a relationship between drought and El Niño events. The
                SPEI was used to quantify the precipitation deficit over time and
                space across the catchment for the time-scales that are important
                for planning and management of water resources. Based on 12-month
                time-scale, the total number of drought events identified in the
                area using SPEI ranged between 13 and 20 during the period of
                analysis (1952–1999). Considering the effects of event magnitude
                and duration as severity parameters, the most severe drought
                event was identified during 1973 followed by 1995 based on
                12-month time-scale. Moreover, it was also found that the number
                of moderate, severe, and extreme drought events identified by
                SPEI follows increasing trend with decade during the period of
                analysis. Results of Spearman’s rank correlation test revealed
                that the trends exhibited by mild (SPEI-3 and SPEI-6), moderate
                (SPEI-12), severe (SPEI-12), and extreme (SPEI-3) drought
                categories are statistically significant at 5\% significance
                level. The study also revealed that drought events in the central
                region of South Africa are preceded by El Niño events in the

                may have been impacted by persistent climatic shift. Thirty years
                after 1982–1984, the period of most intense drought during the
                protracted late 20th century drying of the Sahel, the impact of
                drought on livelihoods and food security is still recognizable in
                the Sahelian center of Mali. This impact is expressed in the
                larger fraction of households in this Sahelian center of the
                country—the agro-ecological transition between pastoralism in the
                north, and sedentary agriculture in the south—who practice
                agriculture but not livestock raising, despite environmental
                conditions that are suitable to their combination. These
                households have lower food security and rely more frequently on
                detrimental nutrition-based coping strategies, such as reducing
                the quantity or quality of meals. In contrast, the more food
                secure households show a clear tendency toward livelihood
                diversification away from subsistence agriculture. These
                households produce less of what they consume, yet spend less on
                food in proportion. The analysis points to the value of
                interdisciplinary research—in this case bridging climate science
                and vulnerability analysis—to gain a dynamical understanding of
                complex systems, understanding which may be exploited to address
                real-world challenges, offering lessons about food security and
                local adaptation strategies in places among the most vulnerable
                to climate.},

    ABSTRACT = {Climate variability and recurrent droughts have caused
                remarkable strain on water resources in most regions across the
                globe, with the arid and semi-arid areas being the hardest hit.
                The impacts have been notable on surface water resources, which
                are already under threat from massive abstractions due to
                increased demand, as well as poor conservation and unsustainable
                land management practices. Drought and climate variability, as
                well as their associated impacts on water resources, have gained
                increased attention in recent decades as nations seek to enhance
                mitigation and adaptation mechanisms. Although the use of
                satellite technologies has, of late, gained prominence in
                generating timely and spatially explicit information on drought
                and climate variability impacts across different regions, they
                are somewhat hampered by difficulties in detecting drought
                evolution due to its complex nature, varying scales, the
                magnitude of its occurrence, and inherent data gaps. Currently, a
                number of studies have been conducted to monitor and assess the
                impacts of climate variability and droughts on water resources in
                sub-Saharan Africa using different remotely sensed and in-situ
                datasets. This study therefore provides a detailed overview of
                the progress made in tracking droughts using remote sensing,
                including its relevance in monitoring climate variability and
                hydrological drought impacts on surface water resources in
                sub-Saharan Africa. The paper further discusses traditional and
                remote sensing methods of monitoring climate variability,
                hydrological drought, and water resources, tracking their
                application and key challenges, with a particular emphasis on
                sub-Saharan Africa. Additionally, characteristics and limitations
                of various remote sensors, as well as drought and surface water
                indices, namely, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI),
                Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), Normalized Difference
                Vegetation (NDVI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), and Water
                Requirement Satisfaction Index (WRSI), Normalized Difference
                Water Index (NDWI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index
                (MNDWI), Land Surface Water Index (LSWI+5), Modified Normalized
                Difference Water Index (MNDWI+5), Automated Water Extraction
                Index (shadow) (AWEIsh), and Automated Water Extraction Index
                (non-shadow) (AWEInsh), and their relevance in climate
                variability and drought monitoring are discussed. Additionally,
                key scientific research strides and knowledge gaps for further
                investigations are highlighted. While progress has been made in
                advancing the application of remote sensing in water resources,
                this review indicates the need for further studies on assessing
                drought and climate variability impacts on water resources,
                especially in the context of climate change and increased water
                demand. The results from this study suggests that Landsat-8 and
                Sentinel-2 satellite data are likely to be best suited to monitor
                climate variability, hydrological drought, and surface water
                bodies, due to their availability at relatively low cost,
                impressive spectral, spatial, and temporal characteristics. The
                most effective drought and water indices are SPI, PDSI, NDVI, VCI
                , NDWI, MNDWI, MNDWI+5, AWEIsh, and AWEInsh. Overall, the
                findings of this study emphasize the increasing role and
                potential of remote sensing in generating spatially explicit
                information on drought and climate variability impacts on surface
                water resources. However, there is a need for future studies to
                consider spatial data integration techniques, radar data,
                precipitation, cloud computing, and machine learning or
                artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to improve on
                understanding climate and drought impacts on water resources
                across various scales.},

    ABSTRACT = {Korea has made various efforts to reduce drought damage; however
                , socio-economic damage has increased in recent years due to
                climate change, which has led to increasing frequency and
                intensity of drought. In South Korea, because precipitation is
                concentrated in the summer, drought damage will be significant in
                the event of failure of water resources management. Seasonal and
                regional imbalances in precipitation have contributed to recent
                extreme droughts in South Korea. In addition, population growth
                and urbanization have led to increased water use and contributed
                to water shortage. Drought risk analysis must address multiple
                contributing factors and comprehensively assess the effects or
                occurrence of future droughts, which are essential for planning
                drought mitigation to cope with actual droughts. Drought
                mitigation depends on the water supply capacity during dry
                spells. In this study, a dynamic naive Bayesian classifier-based
                multiple drought index (DNBC-MDI) was developed by combining the
                strengths of conventional drought indices and water supply
                capacity. The DNBC-MDI was applied to a bivariate drought
                frequency analysis to evaluate hydrologic risk of extreme
                droughts. In addition, future changes of the risk were
                investigated according to climate change scenarios. As a result,
                the drought risk had a decreasing trend from the historic period
                of 1974–2016 to the future period of 2017–2070, then had an
                increasing trend in the period of 2071–2099.},

    ABSTRACT = {Inadequate water supply during droughts, leading to
                socio-economic drought, has become a global issue. In this
                context, the drought resistance and disaster mitigation
                capabilities of reservoirs play a crucial role during drought
                events. Taking the downstream Yellow River Basin (DYRB) as the
                study area, this research analyzes the evolution and
                characteristics of socio-economic drought in the region from 1956
                to 2016 at different time scales (3 months, 6 months, 9 months,
                and 12 months). The copula function is used to calculate the
                joint recurrence period of socio-economic drought in the
                downstream area. In addition, this study constructs a reservoir
                optimization operation model to explore the drought resistance
                capabilities of water supply strategies in response to downstream
                socio-economic droughts. The results show that the indices across
                the four time scales indicate that the DYRB faced the most severe
                socio-economic drought from the 1990s to the early 21st century,
                with long durations and widespread impacts. Compared with
                conventional scheduling methods, water supply restriction
                strategies can cope with more severe socio-economic droughts.
                However, the maximum drought resistance capacity corresponding to
                its recurrence period still cannot cope with the socio-economic
                droughts of the early 21st century. Therefore, the implementation
                of basin-wide unified water planning is of great importance to
                improve drought resistance capacity.},

    abstract = {Along with climate change, drought has been known to be a
                catastrophic and complicated natural calamity that severely
                influences society and individual lives. Among various types of
                droughts, a socioeconomic drought is defined when a watershed is
                not capable of meeting water demands, resulting in water
                shortage. Although meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural
                communities have defined and assessed other types of drought over
                the last decades, there are however few studies that have defined
                and evaluated the socioeconomic drought. This study develops a
                new socioeconomic drought index, named Standardized Water Supply
                and Demand Index (SWSDI), to systematically identify and evaluate
                socioeconomic drought. First, water demand and water supply for a
                watershed (Dongjiang River basin in this study) were evaluated by
                the System Dynamics (SD) model and the Soil and Water Assessment
                Tool (SWAT). With water balance between water supply and water
                converted to the normal distribution function, the SWSDI was
                obtained by a normalization process. Finally, a threshold
                corresponding to a percentile value was determined to identify
                the socioeconomic drought events and further assess the
                characteristics of the socioeconomic drought, such as drought
                duration and severity. Results indicated that socioeconomic
                drought events occurring in the Dongjiang River basin under
                climate change were frequent but moderate and their frequency and
                severity varied with climate scenarios employed in the study. In
                particular, the socioeconomic drought events were frequently
                detected during a transition period from high flow period to low
                flow period and vice versa. An increase in radiation intensity
                induced not only the latency of more severe socioeconomic drought
                events but also an inter-annual distribution of socioeconomic
                drought events that were increasingly concentrated. This study
                showed that SWSDI was effective in identifying and evaluating
                socioeconomic drought, and can be applied to other watersheds.
                This approach can be employed for socioeconomic drought
                monitoring and management.},

    abstract = {Abstract Socioeconomic drought broadly refers to conditions
                whereby the water supply cannot satisfy the demand. Most previous
                studies describe droughts based on large-scale
                meteorological/hydrologic conditions, ignoring the demand and
                local resilience to cope with climate variability. Reservoirs
                provide resilience against climatic extremes and play a key role
                in water supply and demand management. Here we outline a unique
                multivariate approach as a measure of socioeconomic drought,
                termed Multivariate Standardized Reliability and Resilience Index
                (MSRRI). The model combines information on the inflow and
                reservoir storage relative to the demand. MSRRI combines (I) a
                “top-down” approach that focuses on processes/phenomena that
                cannot be simply controlled or altered by decision makers, such
                as climate change and variability, and (II) a “bottom-up”
                methodology that represents the local resilience and societal
                capacity to respond or adapt to droughts. MSRRI is based on a
                nonparametric multivariate distribution function that links
                inflow-demand reliability indicator to water storage resilience
                indicator. These indicators are used to assess socioeconomic
                drought during the Australian Millennium drought (1998–2010) and
                the 2011–2014 California drought. The results show that MSRRI is
                superior to univariate indices because it captures both early
                onset and persistence of water stress over time. The suggested
                framework can be applied to both individual reservoirs and a
                group of reservoirs in a region, and it is consistent with the
                currently available standardized drought indicators. MSRRI
                provides complementary information on socioeconomic drought
                development and recovery based on reservoir storage and demand
                that cannot be achieved from the commonly used drought
                indicators.},

    ABSTRACT = {The devastating socioeconomic impacts of recent droughts have
                intensified the need for improved drought monitoring in South
                Africa (SA). This study has shown that not all indices can be
                universally applicable at all regions worldwide, and there is no
                single index that can represent all aspects of droughts. The aim
                of this study was to review the performance and applicability of
                the Palmer drought severity index (PDSI), surface water supply
                index (SWSI), vegetation condition index (VCI), standardised
                precipitation index (SPI), standardised precipitation
                evapotranspiration index (SPEI), standardised streamflow index
                (SSI), standardised groundwater index (SGI), and GRACE (Gravity
                Recovery and Climate Experiment)-based drought indices in SA and
                provide guidelines for selecting feasible candidates for
                integrated drought monitoring. The review is based on the ‘2016
                World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) Handbook of Drought
                Indicators and Indices’ guidelines. The PDSI and SWSI are not
                feasible in SA, mainly because they are relatively complex to
                compute and interpret and cannot use readily available and
                accessible data. Combining the SPI, SPEI, VCI, SSI, and SGI using
                multi-index or hybrid methods is recommended. Hence, with best
                fitting probability distribution functions (PDFs) used, and with
                an informed choice between parametric and non-parametric
                approaches, this combination has the potential for integrated
                drought monitoring. Due to the scarcity of groundwater data,
                investigations on the use of GRACE-based groundwater drought
                indices must be carried out. These findings may contribute to
                improved drought early warning and monitoring in SA.},

    ABSTRACT = {Drought is one natural disaster with the greatest impact
                worldwide. Southern Africa (SA) is susceptible and vulnerable to
                drought due to its type of climate. In the last four decades,
                droughts have occurred more frequently, with increasing intensity
                and impacts on ecosystems, agriculture, and health. The work
                consists of a systematic literature review on the drought
                regime’s characteristics in the SA under current and future
                climatic conditions, conducted on the Web of Science and Scopus
                platforms, using the PRISMA2020 methodology, with usual and
                appropriate inclusion and exclusion criteria to
                minimize/eliminate the risk of bias, which lead to 53 documents
                published after the year 1987. The number of publications on the
                drought regime in SA is still very small. The country with the
                most drought situations studied is South Africa, and the
                countries with fewer studies are Angola and Namibia. The analysis
                revealed that the main driver of drought in SA is the
                ocean–atmosphere interactions, including the El Niño Southern
                Oscillation. The documents used drought indices, evaluating
                drought descriptors for some regions, but it was not possible to
                identify one publication that reports the complete study of the
                drought regime, including the spatial and temporal distribution
                of all drought descriptors in SA.},

    ABSTRACT = {Drought indices are important resources for monitoring and
                warning of drought impacts. However, regions like New Mexico,
                which are highly vulnerable to drought, as identified by the
                United States Drought Monitor (USDM), lack a comprehensive
                drought monitoring system that integrates multiple
                agrometeorological variables into a single indicator. The purpose
                of this study is to create a Combined Drought Indicator for New
                Mexico (CDI-NM) as an indicator tool for use in monitoring
                historical drought events and measuring its extent across the New
                Mexico. The CDI-NM was constructed using four key variables: the
                Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), temperature, Smoothed
                Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (SMN), and gridded
                rainfall data. A quantitative approach was used to assign weights
                to these variables employing Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
                to produce the CDI-NM. Unlike conventional indices, CDI-NM
                assigns weights to each variable based on their statistical
                contributions, allowing the index to adapt to local spatial and
                temporal drought dynamics. The performance of CDI-NM was
                evaluated against gridded rainfall data using the 3-month
                Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI3) over a 17-year period
                (2003–2019). The results revealed that CDI-NM reliably detected
                moderate and severe droughts with a strong correlation (R2 > 0.8
                and RMSE = 0.10) between both indices for the entire period of
                analysis. CDI-NM showed negative correlation (r < 0) with crop
                yield. While promising, the method assumes linear relationships
                among variables and consistent spatial resolution in the input
                datasets, which may affect its accuracy under certain local
                conditions. Based on the results, the CDI-NM stands out as a
                promising instrument that brings us closer to improved
                decision-making by stakeholders in the fight against agricultural
                droughts throughout New Mexico.},
