## Skripsie — Dynamic Naive Bayes Classifier for Drought Monitoring

This repository contains all code and material developed for my final-year thesis (*Skripsie*) at Stellenbosch University.
The project focused on building a **Dynamic Naive Bayes Classifier (DNBC)** for **composite drought monitoring** in the Southwestern Cape, integrating meteorological, hydrological, and agricultural drought indices (SPI, SDI, NDVI).

The **final report** can be found in the [`docs/`](./docs) folder.
All scripts, data preparation, model implementation, and analysis code used in the development of the report are included in this repository.
